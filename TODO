- replace clunky sink() process with a more elegant 
  capture.output() in standard anova script

- can I turn major operations into functions?

- Get Mean differences of Temperature & RH
  between Chamber Treatments (HOBO Data)
- Load    Moisture Data
- Analyze Moisture Data
- Load    Moss Growth Data
- Analyze Moss Growth Data


- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.

Stop prompts to "Hit <Return> to see next plot:" !!



Current Changes:
================
Standardized Nested ANOVA template - application in process

Results match separate analysis files.  Now I can fix all bugs,
and standardize things in one place!

- annoying prompts after plots are back :(
  - in R GUI console - when source()'d??!
- input commands are being sent to output file ?!
  - a file being source()'d has very different output
	than when being run directly.
	- if echo = TRUE, all commands are output.
	- if echo - FALSE, there is not output!

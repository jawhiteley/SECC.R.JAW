- ANOVA analyses for Cyanobacteria & ARA

- Extract settings from Template:
  - individual analysis scripts would consist of the initial settings part,
    followed by a source() call to the template to do the rest.
  - Or, can I turn major steps into functions?

- Get Mean differences of Temperature & RH
  between Chamber Treatments (HOBO Data)
- Load    Moisture Data
- Analyze Moisture Data
- Load    Moss Growth Data
- Analyze Moss Growth Data


- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.

X Figure out how to  combine store units in SECC attributes in a way that can be combined with text labels.
  X expression( paste() )
  * bquote( .(TextVariable) * " (" * .(quotedExpression) * ")" )



Current Changes:
================
Concatenate Units as quoted expressions

+ Units stored in attributes as `quote(expression)`
  + They can be concatenated with text, or even other quoted expressions
    within `bquote()`
  * bquote( .(TextVariable) * " (" * .(quotedExpression) * ")" )
+ Units have been changed in cleaning scripts
+ This has been implemented in the Template, but not ARA or CB analysis scripts.

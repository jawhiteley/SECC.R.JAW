- allow plotMeans to accept a single value for error, and create appropriate matrix automatically?

- Load    Moisture Data
- Analyze Moisture Data

- Get Mean differences of Temperature & RH
  between Chamber Treatments (HOBO Data)
- Load    Moss Growth Data
- Analyze Moss Growth Data (repeated measures in time)


- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.

- Separate Patch & Meta-Community scale analyses (& output)
  - inside a for loop to do the same thing on each scale of data...
    - collect results for output?
- can I turn major operations of Nested ANOVA script into functions?

- investigate multcomp package for multiple comparisons
- investigate gplot plackage for plotmeans function? (see Quick-R).

- Build a Main control script to source() individual analysis scripts in one step each.

Current Changes:
================
Applied new MSR to ARA & Cyanobacteria Results

+ started building '_Main' analysis script as control center to batch-execute other analyses.
+ Re-ran ARA & Cyanobacteria with new MSD method.
  - MSD is NaN for Time ?!
- Removed old Heterocyst results (to reflect the fact that they are essentially deprecated).

- Regressions
  - ARA vs. Cyanobacteria - GLM(M)
  + Include H2O
    ~ as a covariate?
    + as another explanatory variable
    - partial regression (after removing effects of moisture?)
    ~ quadratic term (is the relationship unimodal?  P-value actually smaller than linear term)
  - aggregate patches together ('regional / metacommunity' scale)
    - one less factor (position)
    - less noise in Ambient treatments?
    - more unexplained noise in Chambers (Inner vs. Outer)?
  + Combine Chamber & Position into 'Climate' pseudo-factor
    + fewer main effects & interactions
    - Nesting not as clear
  + Spatial autocorrelation
    - improves the AIC, but not much effect on residuals
    - Variogram shows overall decline: what does this even mean?
  - Zero-inflated regression?
    - separate out zeros from non-zero data in 2-stage model.
  - Quantile Regression
    - Crawley R book
    - nonparametric: test for slope of (upper) bound, rather than explaining full variation
  - Include only Stigonema (or Nostoc) in analysis & see if it makes a difference
    - can individual species by included as explanatory variables as well as the total, to compare relative importance?
  - Bootstrapping to overcome "Fixed X" violation?

- adjust cyanobacteria counts in rows with 'faint' in the Notes
  - reduce by 50%?  25 - 75%?
  - weighting?  Remove from analysis as missing data?

- Load    Moss Growth Data
- Analyze Moss Growth Data (repeated measures in time)

~ Analyze Fauna Data

- Load    Ion Resin Data
- Analyze Ion Resin Data

- fix SECCstr to handle errors with aggregated data sets (line 304)
- check why checkSECCdata() does not catch invalid SampleID's :(


- investigate multcomp package for multiple comparisons
X investigate gplots package for plotmeans function? (see Quick-R).
  - just use ggplot2

- allow plotMeans to accept a single value for error, and create appropriate matrix automatically?

- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.

- Separate Patch & Meta-Community scale analyses (& output)
  - inside a for loop to do the same thing on each scale of data...
    - collect results for output?
- can I turn major operations of Nested ANOVA script into functions?

- Check LSD calculations
- allow plotMeans to accept a single value for error, and create appropriate matrix automatically?

- Load    Moisture Data
- Analyze Moisture Data

- Get Mean differences of Temperature & RH
  between Chamber Treatments (HOBO Data)
- Load    Moss Growth Data
- Analyze Moss Growth Data (repeated measures in time)


- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.

- Separate Patch & Meta-Community scale analyses
  - inside a for loop to do the same thing on each scale of data...
    - collect results for output?
- can I turn major operations of Nested ANOVA script into functions?

- investigate multcomp package for multiple comparisons
- investigate gplot plackage for plotmeans function? (see Quick-R).

- Build a Main control script to source() individual analysis scripts in one step each.

Current Changes:
================
LSD -> MSD for full 'aovlist'

+ LSD() changed to MSD() to be more generic
  + specify method = "LSD" or "planned" for LSD
  + specify method = "MSR" or "unplanned" for MSRs (Tukey HSD)
+ MSD() uses MSE from nested model level for each comparison
  + but df are calculated according to number of comparisons in each treatment group.
+ new MSD() applied to main ANOVA script.
- Am I using the correct degrees of freedom and/or n?
  Welcome to friggin' nested (i.e. hierarchical) models.  Oy!
  - n = # of observations in each group, or # of groups?
  - df depends on whether you think the comparisons are planned (LSD for any 2 comparisons) or unplanned (MSD / Tukey's HSD).

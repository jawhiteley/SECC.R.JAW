- ANOVA analyses for Cyanobacteria & ARA

- Get Mean differences of Temperature & RH
  between Chamber Treatments (HOBO Data)
- Load    Moisture Data
- Analyze Moisture Data
- Load    Moss Growth Data
- Analyze Moss Growth Data


- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.





Current Changes:
================
Started ARA analysis - building standard functions and process

+ Added some housecleaning to 'load.R' to detach packages used.
  - I had to wrap them in try() in case other loaded packages require the ones I was trying to detach.
+ Added some documentation to 'Loading Data.txt'
+ Added a few missing labels to 'clean_cyanobacteria.R'
+ Added 'SECC_sampleID()' function to auto-concatenate factor codes into standard SampeIDs.
  currently unused, but could be put to use in loading functions...
+ Added 'SECC_aggregate()' function to consistently aggregate SECC data frames,
  up to specified treatment (typically Fragmentation or Position).

X Check unbalanced and missing data rows in SECC.
- Check Block 6 Cyanobacteria thread data

- Try using the labels argument of factor() to add informative labels without re-coding all the ID factors.

* ARA ID changes (to match template):
  31A-3.E

* Cyanobacteria ID changes (to match template):
  11A-4.W
  21C-4.N
  31A-1.E

Current Changes:
================
Cyanobacteria & t1 ARA load properly.
  * Cyanobacteria data loading works (numbers check out as far as I can tell).
  * ARA t1 loads properly
  * ARA t1 was missing several values, due to NAs in the Controls & Blanks 
    (especially Pos=N/S/E/W in certain Blocks?), leading to NAs in the calculated columns.
  * Fixed bugs in calculations for ARA.  
  * ARA t1 Block 4 has a Blank with 0, which is strange.
    The Excel spreadsheet referenced the wrong cell for blanks in t4, 
    leading to mismatch between calculated values in R vs. Excel for block 4

- Attributes of SECC data frame are not being combined properly :-(

X combine attributes into SECC data frame

- Check Block 6 Cyanobacteria thread data

- Try using the labels argument of factor() to add informative labels without re-coding all the ID factors.


Current Changes:
================
- Attributes of SECC data frame are now aggregated correctly
  I'm still not sure at what point in the merge loop attributes
  are lost, I just know that it works if I extract and combine
  attributes near the beginning.

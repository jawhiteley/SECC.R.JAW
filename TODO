- Check LSD calculations
- allow plotMeans to accept a single value for error, and create appropriate matrix automatically?


- Add plotMap for Position
- Change interaction plots to put designed treatment along x-axis instead of position.
- Load    Moisture Data
- Analyze Moisture Data

- Get Mean differences of Temperature & RH
  between Chamber Treatments (HOBO Data)
- Load    Moss Growth Data
- Analyze Moss Growth Data (repeated measures in time)


- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.

- Separate Patch & Meta-Community scale analyses
  - inside a for loop to do the same thing on each scale of data...
    - collect results for output?
- can I turn major operations of Nested ANOVA script into functions?




Current Changes:
================
Dropped Partial Chambers, re-arranged output plots

+ Changed interaction plots to put designed factors along x-axis, with position as a second factor (with plotmap).
  - Had to change order in plotMeans call, *AND* error matrix creation.
+ Dropped Partial Chambers from ARA & cyanobacteria analyses (not default settings, however).
+ Position PlotMap
+ Combined plotMap functions, with factor argument to choose which one to return. :P

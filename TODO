- ANOVA analyses for Cyanobacteria & ARA

- Extract settings from Template:
  - individual analysis scripts would consist of the initial settings part,
    followed by a source() call to the template to do the rest.
  - Or, can I turn major steps into functions?

- Get Mean differences of Temperature & RH
  between Chamber Treatments (HOBO Data)
- Load    Moisture Data
- Analyze Moisture Data
- Load    Moss Growth Data
- Analyze Moss Growth Data


- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.

- Figure out how to  combine store units in SECC attributes in a way that can be combined with text labels.
  - expression( paste() )
  - bquote( paste( .(TextVariable), ) )



Current Changes:
================
ARA & cyanobacteria nested ANOVA - Output Results

+ Output results to files
  + minor changes to output format.
+ added check for factor levels to LSD() function
  + should be slightly more robust.

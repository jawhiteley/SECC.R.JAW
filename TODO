- Add the option to include Time as a factor in nested ANOVA
- can I turn major operations of Nested ANOVA script into functions?

- Add plotMap for Position
- Change interaction plots to put designed treatment along x-axis instead of position.

- Get Mean differences of Temperature & RH
  between Chamber Treatments (HOBO Data)
- Load    Moisture Data
- Analyze Moisture Data
- Load    Moss Growth Data
- Analyze Moss Growth Data (repeated measures in time)


- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.



Current Changes:
================
Time as a treatment in Nested ANOVA

+ Added Time as a treatment in Nested ANOVA
  + only if there is more than one Time level selected.
  + no special graphs or other output (yet).
+ re-did results for ARA, Cyanobacteria, and added analysis of Heterocysts (Hcells)
+ moved loading of labels to *after* calculations.
  + I realized this made more sense, in case new columns & properties needed to be added, they are now accessible in the label-making script.
+ Added calculations & attributes for heterocysts (Hcells)
- Removed old(!) results for "Nfix".  I'd rather use ARA, I think.
  Easy to re-generate if desired.

* These new steps are pretty standard - they could be in a separate file, except for the need to allow for custom labels (really?)
  - could be a function, but I'd need to include 'code' (another function) to calculate *each* label.

* Removed Frag from nested error terms in Meta-Community-level analyses.  
  It should not be there? (see Crawley, pp. 469-470)

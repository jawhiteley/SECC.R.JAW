- allow plotMeans to accept a single value for error, and create appropriate matrix automatically?
- Interaction plots at each time point, within full analysis of all time points.

- Load    Moisture Data
- Analyze Moisture Data

- Get Mean differences of Temperature & RH
  between Chamber Treatments (HOBO Data)
- Load    Moss Growth Data
- Analyze Moss Growth Data (repeated measures in time)


- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.

- Separate Patch & Meta-Community scale analyses (& output)
  - inside a for loop to do the same thing on each scale of data...
    - collect results for output?
- can I turn major operations of Nested ANOVA script into functions?

- investigate multcomp package for multiple comparisons
- investigate gplot plackage for plotmeans function? (see Quick-R).

- Modify _Main.R script to collect results from each analysis, and produce results for manuscript
- Each manuscript will have it's own script, which performs all analyses, collect results, and produce output and final plots for publication.
  - For now, individual 'sub-scripts' clear memory & re-load data with 'init.R'.  
    Will it be safer to move init.R, or just clear memory, to the higher-order scripts?


Current Changes:
================
Moisture (H2O) Analysis & Results

+ H2O results 
+ Started a script for Chapter 1: ARA-cyanobacteria (with H2O, etc.)

ARA cyanobacteria regression models
================================
- Regressions: ARA vs. Cyanobacteria - GLM(M)
  - GLMM: What's the best (linear) model?
  - GAMM: check for non-linearity?
  - Zero-inflated regression?
    - separate out zeros from non-zero data in 2-stage model.
  - Quantile Regression
    - Crawley R book
    - nonparametric: test for slope of (upper) bound, rather than explaining full variation

- Things to try to improve Regression models?
  + Include H2O
    ~ as a covariate?
    + as another explanatory variable
    + partial regression (after removing effects of moisture?)
    + quadratic term (is the relationship unimodal?  P-value actually smaller than linear term)
  + Include Block as a fixed effect, rather than random effect?
    - If there is an effect, we should know about it and be able to look at possible interactions.
    - This does not preclude allowing variances to change across Blocks, or other LMM extensions.
  ~ Separate Analyses for each Time point.
  + Combine Chamber & Position into 'Climate' pseudo-factor
    + fewer main effects & interactions
    - Nesting not as clear
  + Spatial autocorrelation
    - improves the AIC, but not much effect on residuals
    - Variogram shows overall decline: what does this even mean?
  X aggregate patches together ('regional / metacommunity' scale)
    - one less factor (position)
    - less noise in Ambient treatments?
    - more unexplained noise in Chambers (Inner vs. Outer)?
  - Include only Stigonema (or Nostoc) in analysis & see if it makes a difference
    - can individual species by included as explanatory variables as well as the total, to compare relative importance?
    - they are largely colinear, except maybe at small abundances.
  - Bootstrapping to overcome "Fixed X" violation?

- adjust cyanobacteria counts in rows with 'faint' in the Notes
  - reduce by 50%?  25 - 75%?
  - weighting?  Remove from analysis as missing data?

Microarthropods: Fauna
================================
~ Constrained ordination?
- Nestedness?
- Other multivariate analyses?

Ecosystem Processes
================================

+ Load    Moss Growth Data
~ Analyze Moss Growth Data (repeated measures in time)
  - Repeated measures / Nested analysis of year 1 vs. year 2
  - Convert Productivity to g / area / time
  - Estimate amount of "standing stock" of Moss, in g / area
    - use Decomp. mass loss rates to calculate Decomp. in g / area / time.
    - Compare Decomposition & Production : balance under various experimental conditions?

+ Load    Ion Resin Data
+ Analyze Ion Resin Data



Project, Functions
================================
- Add Latex export of tables to ANOVA output

- fix SECCstr to handle errors with aggregated data sets (line 304)
- check why checkSECCdata() does not catch invalid SampleID's :(


- allow plotMeans to accept a single value for error, and create appropriate matrix automatically?

- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.

- Separate Patch & Meta-Community scale analyses (& output)
  - inside a for loop to do the same thing on each scale of data...
    - collect results for output?
- can I turn major operations of Nested ANOVA script into functions?

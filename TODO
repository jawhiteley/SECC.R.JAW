- Regressions
  - ARA vs. Cyanobacteria - GLM(M)
  - Include H2O
    - as a covariate?
    - as another explanatory variable
    - partial regression (after removing effects of moisture?)

- adjust cyanobacteria counts in rows with 'faint' in the Notes
  - reduce by 50%?  25 - 75%?
  - weighting?  Remove from analysis as missing data?

- Get Mean differences of Temperature & RH
  between Chamber Treatments (HOBO Data)
- Load    Moss Growth Data
- Analyze Moss Growth Data (repeated measures in time)

- fix SECCstr to handle errors with aggregated data sets (line 304)


- investigate multcomp package for multiple comparisons
- investigate gplot plackage for plotmeans function? (see Quick-R).

- allow plotMeans to accept a single value for error, and create appropriate matrix automatically?
- Interaction plots at each time point, within full analysis of all time points.
  - Loop through each time point, then make plots.
  - Allow for Time not being included in the model

- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.

- Separate Patch & Meta-Community scale analyses (& output)
  - inside a for loop to do the same thing on each scale of data...
    - collect results for output?
- can I turn major operations of Nested ANOVA script into functions?


Current Changes:
================


Moved strip_empty_dims() function to miscellaneous functions, corrected a minor bug with dimensions.

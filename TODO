- Finish load script for ARA & cyanobacteria data, at least.
- Summary information on SECC data-frame
  - # of values of each factor level, for each response variable: check for inconsistencies, missing values.
  - not including NAs

- Try using the labels argument of factor() to add informative labels without re-coding all the ID factors.

* ARA ID changes (to match template):
  31A-3.E

* Cyanobacteria ID changes (to match template):
  11A-4.W
  21C-4.N
  31A-1.E

Current Changes:
================
* ARA ID changed (to match template):  31A-3.E
* Cyanobacteria ID changes (to match template):
  11A-4.W
  21C-4.N
  31A-1.E
+ Added `quote = FALSE` to print() statements in error messages of checkSECCdata(),
  to stop strings from being printed with quotes around them.
+ Added options to checkSECCdata() to control whether to:
  * check actual values, and change to match standards
  * check for duplicates.
  Both options are useful to skip during individual file processing, but are still
  used in final check before merge.
+ Started `SECCdata_summary` function, to provide summary data (counts) 
  for each response variable, at each level of ID factors.
- There are still some bugs in the merge / calculations to fix.

+ Added check to load script for cyanobacteria, for the fact that
  there should be exactly 2 of each ID: 
  otherwise, there may be duplicates or missing pairs.
+ Cyanobacteria calculations now occur *BEFORE* aggregating (the mean of f() != f(mean))

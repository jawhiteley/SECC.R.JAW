- ANOVA analyses for Cyanobacteria & ARA

- Get Mean differences of Temperature & RH
  between Chamber Treatments (HOBO Data)
- Load    Moisture Data
- Analyze Moisture Data
- Load    Moss Growth Data
- Analyze Moss Growth Data


- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.

- Figure out how to store units in SECC attributes in a way that can be combined with text labels.
  - expression( paste() )
  - bquote( paste( .(TextVariable), ) )



Current Changes:
================
ARA analysis - building template and standard functions

+ ARA analysis for all time points
- ARA results differ very slightly (at 2+ decimal points) from original results
  - Partly because old results did not include Controls (I had ignored them because of all the -ve values)
  - also, the formula mistakes in block 4 (incorrect cell referenced in old Excel file for blanks in Block 4).
  - The new calcs have a higher precision (?) I am attributing minor differences in results to these 'rounding errors'.
  - The final graphs look nearly identical, however (once corrected for different inputs).
+ Nested ANOVA template
  + Flexible enough to handle most univariate analyses at this point.
    Just change the settings near the top, and let fly!
+ adjusted LSD() function to be a little more robust
+ added attributes to SECC output data fram for "Nfix" column
- trying ways of formatting units in final output graphs
  - can only combine text variables and raw math in-line (not as variables).
- R keeps prompting to "Hit <Return> to see next plot:", despite par(ask = TRUE).
  - This also causes R to hang, waiting for input that will never come,
    Whenever I send a whole region / file to be evaluated :(
  - C-g to interrupt & escape.
  - Try: options("device.ask.default") or devAskNewPage() instead?

I keep forgetting to delete the extra columns in SECC_ARA_t1.csv!
  Fortunately, they don't have much of an effect on importing & processing.

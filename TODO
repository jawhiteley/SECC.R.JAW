X Check Block 6 Cyanobacteria thread data
X Check Blanks with values of 0 for C2H4.

- Check cyanobacteria data for outliers?
- Check ARA data for outliers?

X Change names of "load_...R" files to "clean_...R"?
~ Tweak ARA calculations (of Controls & Blanks) in t2 & t4 to match Excel values as much as possible. 

- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.
- Try using the labels argument of factor() to add informative labels without re-coding all the ID factors.

- ANOVA analyses for Cyanobacteria & ARA






Current Changes:
================
Checked calculations, clean-up

+ Added a calculated column in Excel ARA spreadsheet for 
  '%C2H4 ARA' (C2H4 as % of C2H4 + C2H2)
  - Changed details of "ARA.calcs" to make it easier to verify calculations.
+ Checked ARA values of 0: they are, in fact, too small to detect / measure.
+ Verified & tweaked Cyanobacteria calculations: they should be easier to follow (for me, anyway).

ARA Calculation formulas: standardize by umol/ml or umol of ARA gases (C2H2 + C2H4)?
================================
ARA calculation formulas -- How do the final values compare:

  * standardizing blanks by C2H2 (+ C2H4)
  * standardizing blanks & controls by umol / volume?
  * using 'raw' umol amounts?

The difference appears to be very minor: 4th+ decimal place.

  - There are 4 more values >0 in t2 using volumetric standardization, 
    but I strongly suspect these are extremely small values anyway.  
    I wouldn't worry about it.
  - The difference in t4 is not noticeable.

The large number of values < 0 has more to do with extremely small values
  that are smaller than the Controls / Blanks (especially the Controls).


Project should be ready for Cyanobacteria & ARA analysis.

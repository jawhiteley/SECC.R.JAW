+ Change "Continuous" Fragmentation treatment to "Contiguous"
  Change "other" Patch Position to "intermediate"
  - re-generate graphs & output :/
  - something changes the way summary() (and coef) labels factor levels in the output: with 'coded' factor levels, rather than the labels
    - It seems to work as expected when running regression scripts (e.g. CH1 3_ARA~cb_Models), but NOT if these scripts are run *after* the univariate scripts (e.g. H2O.R)
    - It works as expected during individual analyses, but not when re-running all scripts :(
    - summary() also works differently on model objects *fitted* at different points in the load order:
      - saved (glmulti) objects generate different output than new objects, if they were generated before/after running the univariate scripts.
      * ** This suggests the order of scripts may not affect the summary() method, but model fitting itself (and the way functions like summary() and coef() work on them.  :(
    - Something changes in memory, which is not reset by `rm(list=ls())` 
        - this suggests a package issue / conflict / order
        - but unloading packages and allowing them to be reloaded doesn't solve the problem :(
        - is there masking going on?
        - does the order of loading packages matter?
    - *** The problem is that the nested ANOVA function changes the option() for 'contrasts'
        - options(contrasts=c("contr.sum","contr.poly"))
        - I need to learn better what this actually does :/
        - in the meantime, I'll add a line to `init.R` to re-set these settings to default values.
      
Change fileformat of all data files to unix (or dos) for portability.
  - This should not affect the processing or output on my machine (check), but would make it easier for others to read.

ARA cyanobacteria regression models
================================
- Compute Effect Sizes for nested ANOVAs (SS_trt / SS_total)

- Regressions: ARA vs. Cyanobacteria - GLM(M)
  - GLMM: What's the best (linear) model?
  - GAMM: check for non-linearity?
  - Zero-inflated regression?
    - separate out zeros from non-zero data in 2-stage model.
  - Quantile Regression
    - Crawley R book
    - nonparametric: test for slope of (upper) bound, rather than explaining full variation

- Things to try to improve Regression models?
  + Include H2O
    ~ as a covariate?
    + as another explanatory variable
    + partial regression (after removing effects of moisture?)
    + quadratic term (is the relationship unimodal?  P-value actually smaller than linear term)
  + Include Block as a fixed effect, rather than random effect?
    - If there is an effect, we should know about it and be able to look at possible interactions.
    - This does not preclude allowing variances to change across Blocks, or other LMM extensions.
  ~ Separate Analyses for each Time point.
  + Combine Chamber & Position into 'Climate' pseudo-factor
    + fewer main effects & interactions
    - Nesting not as clear
  + Spatial autocorrelation
    - improves the AIC, but not much effect on residuals
    - Variogram shows overall decline: what does this even mean?
  X aggregate patches together ('regional / metacommunity' scale)
    - one less factor (position)
    - less noise in Ambient treatments?
    - more unexplained noise in Chambers (Inner vs. Outer)?
    - aggregate over meaningful treatments: e.g. all inner & outer patches, regardless of fragmentation?
  - Include only Stigonema (or Nostoc) in analysis & see if it makes a difference
    - can individual species by included as explanatory variables as well as the total, to compare relative importance?
    - they are largely colinear, except maybe at small abundances.
  - Bootstrapping to overcome "Fixed X" violation?

- adjust cyanobacteria counts in rows with 'faint' in the Notes
  - reduce by 50%?  25 - 75%?
  - weighting?  Remove from analysis as missing data?


Moss Growth
================================

x ANOVA with unbalanced data (using type II SS after checking for interactions), rather than interpreting type I SS?
  x I cannot perform a nested ANOVA with unbalanced data in R using the aov() or lm() functions: that's why I use lme() ...

Microarthropods: Fauna
================================
+ Use 2-3 transformations / measures of association to compare importance of abundant species.
+ Mantel Test: is patch similarity correlated with physical distance?
+ Partial Mantel Test: are experimental treatments different, after partialing out spatial similarities?
+ Variogram (Borcard et al. 2011): scales of similarity?
- Nestedness?
+ Correlations between Predators, Grazers, and Cyanobacteria
  ~ trophic cascade?
~ Proportion of Predators / Mesostigs / Collembola, etc. vs. Species Richness (non-random extinctions?)
+ Table of species presence / absence by experimental treatment

AG:
I am curious about changes in patterns of community diversity per patch across treatments. Could you calculate Renyi entropy (see Vegan package) for each community of predators and grazers. What about community abundance distributions (e.g SADs).

I believe Shawn Leroux developed a simple index for estimating the strength of a trophic cascade.
I think it is in this paper: Leroux, S.J. & Loreau, M. (2010). Consumer-mediated recycling and cascading trophic interactions. Ecology 91:2162-2171.
JAW: log-response ratio.  Need to compare a situation with & without a particular trophic level.
Not very applicable in this case, as I have only a single patch with no predators.
also in:
Schmitz, O. J. 2006. Predators have large effects on ecosystem properties by changing plant diversity, not plant biomass. Ecology 87:1432-1437.


-> Reorganize files: separate Univariate and multivariate code into separate scripts (called from main script, to collect all results?)


Follow-up analyses (in later chapter?)
________________________________
~ Constrained ordination?
    - CCA
    - RDA
- Other multivariate analyses?

- Explore: relationships between fauna, richness & decomposition, available N
    - BD-EF?


Ecosystem Processes
================================


Productivity - Decomposition Balance
________________________________
+ Calculate net g gained or lost  / time
    + Productivity - Decomposition
    + per patch
    - mean & CI
    - SD: variability**
* investigate borderline Fragmentation effects in moss growth (t3)



SYNTHESIS
================================

~ Multiple Regressions
  ~ Cyanobacteria density (per shoot?  scaled up to m^2 by dwt)
    - H2O
    - TAN
    - Frag
  ~ Nfix (with more variables)
    - H2O + H2O^2
    - Chamber:Position (or Chamber:H2O:...?  Still doesn't account for missing dry patches in Ambient)
    - Frag: H2O
    - Cells
    - TAN
  ~ Moss Growth
    - H2O
    - Chamber:Position
    - N-fixation (after H2O)
    - TAN
  X Decomposition?  (see Fauna chapter)

- Redo analyses with more sensible terms and interactions
  - There are no dry patches in the ambient, which can do screwy things to predicted values in ambient only.
  - For now, I've had to remove all Chamber interactions.
  - I really should include Position, to account for Chamber:Position interactions
    - Collapse Chamber & Position into a 'Climate' factor with 3 levels: Ambient, Inner Chamber, Outer Chamber ?
    - Inner Chamber = "Warm"; Outer Chamber = "Warm + Dry"
    * BUT: this hogs too much variance away from moisture (they are confounded / co-linear).
      - probably actually better to stick with just Chamber, and limit interactions that will cause unrealistic fitted values for non-existent ambient patches with low moisture.
  - Try to start over and choose sensible interactions a priori
    - See if I can use all of them, or if I need to screen some out
    - use glmulti output to screen out any that are not "important"
    - proceed as before
  - Partial out main Block effects before proceeding with the rest of the analysis?
    - Will not allow Block: interactions
      - I'm not really interested in them anyway, but they can account for a fair amount of variation.
    - could be harder to interpret

* Structural Equation Modelling of multiple variables
  - compare alternative models with & without links between fauna & decomposition?  Others?
  - This is what I really need, but don't have time to learn it (before the thesis deadline) :(

X constrained ordinations of Fauna data?
  - I don't have fauna data from all blocks, so if I include it in multiple regressions above, I will lose a lot of replication
  - BUT, I might be able to go the other way, and explore associations between Fana spp & ecosystem variables ...
  - Do this as part of Chapter 2 (Keep Chapter 4 about the moss - cyanobacteria - N-fixation association)



Project, Functions
================================

- fix SECCstr to handle errors with aggregated data sets (line 304)
- check why checkSECCdata() does not catch invalid SampleID's :(


X allow plotMeans to accept a single value for error, and create appropriate matrix automatically?

- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.

- Separate Patch & Meta-Community scale analyses (& output)
  - inside a for loop to do the same thing on each scale of data...
    - collect results for output?
- can I turn major operations of Nested ANOVA script into functions?

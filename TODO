X Check cyanobacteria data for outliers?
X Check ARA data for outliers?
X Check Cyanobacteria calculated values are in the right ball-park (compare to lit. values)
X Check ARA calculated values are in the right ball-park (compare to lit. values)

- ANOVA analyses for Cyanobacteria & ARA

- Get Mean differences of Temperature & RH
  between Chamber Treatments (HOBO Data)
- Imort   Moisture Data
- Analyze Moisture Data
- Imort   Moss Growth Data
- Analyze Moss Growth Data


- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.
X Try using the labels argument of factor() to add informative labels without re-coding all the ID factors.
  - labels replace the factor levels (as new level labels .. go figure!)





Current Changes:
================
Check range of calculated values

Checked Cyanobacteria & ARA calculated values to make sure they are in the right ballpark,
compared to other values in the literature.
- added some exploratory plots (histograms & boxplots) to load files to check distributions & ranges.
- ARA values ok
- Cyanobacteria values seem high, by a couple orders of magnitude!
  - The median values are actually in about the same range, but the few big values are really big!
    This is to be expected with such a skewed distribution.
Added Cells/shoot ("Cells") and Cells/g ("Cells.g") columns to cyanobacteria data.
- More natural demarcation of units, Easier to compare with some published values, 
  and more consistent with ARA conventions
  (H.cells: Heterocysts are now cells/shoot)
House-keeping & general clean-up of code

Project is ready for Cyanobacteria & ARA analysis.

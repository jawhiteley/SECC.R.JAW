Fix final plots so that points are on top of lines

ARA cyanobacteria regression models
================================
- Regressions: ARA vs. Cyanobacteria - GLM(M)
  - GLMM: What's the best (linear) model?
  - GAMM: check for non-linearity?
  - Zero-inflated regression?
    - separate out zeros from non-zero data in 2-stage model.
  - Quantile Regression
    - Crawley R book
    - nonparametric: test for slope of (upper) bound, rather than explaining full variation

- Things to try to improve Regression models?
  + Include H2O
    ~ as a covariate?
    + as another explanatory variable
    + partial regression (after removing effects of moisture?)
    + quadratic term (is the relationship unimodal?  P-value actually smaller than linear term)
  + Include Block as a fixed effect, rather than random effect?
    - If there is an effect, we should know about it and be able to look at possible interactions.
    - This does not preclude allowing variances to change across Blocks, or other LMM extensions.
  ~ Separate Analyses for each Time point.
  + Combine Chamber & Position into 'Climate' pseudo-factor
    + fewer main effects & interactions
    - Nesting not as clear
  + Spatial autocorrelation
    - improves the AIC, but not much effect on residuals
    - Variogram shows overall decline: what does this even mean?
  X aggregate patches together ('regional / metacommunity' scale)
    - one less factor (position)
    - less noise in Ambient treatments?
    - more unexplained noise in Chambers (Inner vs. Outer)?
  - Include only Stigonema (or Nostoc) in analysis & see if it makes a difference
    - can individual species by included as explanatory variables as well as the total, to compare relative importance?
    - they are largely colinear, except maybe at small abundances.
  - Bootstrapping to overcome "Fixed X" violation?

- adjust cyanobacteria counts in rows with 'faint' in the Notes
  - reduce by 50%?  25 - 75%?
  - weighting?  Remove from analysis as missing data?

Microarthropods: Fauna
================================
+ Use 2-3 transformations / measures of association to compare importance of abundant species.
+ Mantel Test: is patch similarity correlated with physical distance?
+ Partial Mantel Test: are experimental treatments different, after partialing out spatial similarities?
+ Variogram (Borcard et al. 2011): scales of similarity?
- Nestedness?
+ Correlations between Predators, Grazers, and Cyanobacteria
  ~ trophic cascade?
- Table of species presnce / absence by experimental treatment

AG:
I am curious about changes in patterns of community diversity per patch across treatments. Could you calculate Renyi entropy (see Vegan package) for each community of predators and grazers. What about community abundance distributions (e.g SADs).

I believe Shawn Leroux developed a simple index for estimating the strength of a trophic cascade.
I think it is in this paper: Leroux, S.J. & Loreau, M. (2010). Consumer-mediated recycling and cascading trophic interactions. Ecology 91:2162-2171.
JAW: log-response ratio.  Need to compare a situation with & without a particular trophic level.
Not very applicable in this case, as I have only a single patch with no predators.
also in:
Schmitz, O. J. 2006. Predators have large effects on ecosystem properties by changing plant diversity, not plant biomass. Ecology 87:1432-1437.


Follow-up analyses in later chapter
________________________________
~ Constrained ordination?
- Other multivariate analyses?



Ecosystem Processes
================================

+ Load    Moss Growth Data
~ Analyze Moss Growth Data (repeated measures in time)
  - Repeated measures / Nested analysis of year 1 vs. year 2
    - Time / Year (1 & 2) as a categorical factor - at the **lowest** nesting level
    - e.g., Block / Chamber / Frag / Position / Year
  - Convert Productivity to g / area / time
  - Estimate amount of "standing stock" of Moss, in g / area
    - use Decomp. mass loss rates to calculate Decomp. in g / area / time.
    - Compare Decomposition & Production : balance under various experimental conditions?

Productivity - Decomposition Balance
________________________________
- Calculate Decomposition rate as g lost / area / time
    - g lost = % lost * g of moss in patch (?)
- Calculate net g gained or lost  / time
    - Productivity - Decomposition
    - per patch
    - mean & CI
    - SD: variability**
- What is the approximate Carbon content of Pleurozium Schreberi?
  - g moss -> g Carbon
- Extrapolate wildly to the Boreal Forest (of Quebec / Canada / The world)
  - or, just get a km^2 measurement and see if that sounds impressive.

- compare average dry weight of various treatments through time?
  - nested ANOVA on Patch.dwt
  - Is the overall dry wt of outer chamber patches naturally lower?

+ Load    Ion Resin Data
+ Analyze Ion Resin Data


SYNTHESIS
================================



Project, Functions
================================

- fix SECCstr to handle errors with aggregated data sets (line 304)
- check why checkSECCdata() does not catch invalid SampleID's :(


- allow plotMeans to accept a single value for error, and create appropriate matrix automatically?

- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.

- Separate Patch & Meta-Community scale analyses (& output)
  - inside a for loop to do the same thing on each scale of data...
    - collect results for output?
- can I turn major operations of Nested ANOVA script into functions?

- Regressions
  - ARA vs. Cyanobacteria - GLM(M)
  - Include H2O as a covariate.

- Get Mean differences of Temperature & RH
  between Chamber Treatments (HOBO Data)
- Load    Moss Growth Data
- Analyze Moss Growth Data (repeated measures in time)

- fix SECCstr to handle errors with aggregated data sets (line 304)


- investigate multcomp package for multiple comparisons
- investigate gplot plackage for plotmeans function? (see Quick-R).

- allow plotMeans to accept a single value for error, and create appropriate matrix automatically?
- Interaction plots at each time point, within full analysis of all time points.
  - Loop through each time point, then make plots.
  - Allow for Time not being included in the model

- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.

- Separate Patch & Meta-Community scale analyses (& output)
  - inside a for loop to do the same thing on each scale of data...
    - collect results for output?
- can I turn major operations of Nested ANOVA script into functions?

- Modify _Main.R script to collect results from each analysis, and produce results for manuscript


Current Changes:
================
GLMM draft: ARA vs cyanobacteria

+ started converting old GLM script to use new project structure.
  - still need to handle predictions.
  - Random effects / hierarchical structure?

+ SECCclean() function to perfom standard pruning
  + drop empty rows
  + drop unused factor levels

+ fixed a mistake in calculation of Heterocyst density (Hcells.m was getting same values as Cells).

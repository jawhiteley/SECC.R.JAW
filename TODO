X Check cyanobacteria data for outliers?
X Check ARA data for outliers?

- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.
~ Try using the labels argument of factor() to add informative labels without re-coding all the ID factors.
  - labels replace the factor levels (as new level labels .. go figure!)

- ANOVA analyses for Cyanobacteria & ARA






Current Changes:
================
Checked data, final prep & checks.

Checked Cyanobacteria data for outliers and data entry errors (caught a few)
Checked Cyanobacteria calculations
Checked ARA data for outliers (nothing really stood out)
Checked ARA calculations

Tweaked final calculations in load.R (easier to follow?)

Project should be ready for Cyanobacteria & ARA analysis.

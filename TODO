- Finish load script for ARA & cyanobacteria data, at least.
X Summary information on SECC data-frame
  - # of values of each factor level, for each response variable: check for inconsistencies, missing values.

* ARA ID changes (to match template):
  31A-3.E

* Cyanobacteria ID changes (to match template):
  11A-4.W
  21C-4.N

================
* Re-encoded data files (non UTF-8 encodings causing errors when loading in R-Mac-GUI).
* Changed `SECCdata_summary()` function to `SECCstr`.
  + SECCstr now works: removed 'SampleID' from ID columns to process, which made loops insanely long.

X Check cyanobacteria data for outliers?
X Check ARA data for outliers?

- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.
~ Try using the labels argument of factor() to add informative labels without re-coding all the ID factors.
  - labels replace the factor levels (as new level labels .. go figure!)

- ANOVA analyses for Cyanobacteria & ARA






Current Changes:
================
Neater factor recoding?

Changed the methods used to recode factor levels 
using `levels` and `labels` arguments to factor()
Should be more consistent, easier to read?

Project should be ready for Cyanobacteria & ARA analysis.

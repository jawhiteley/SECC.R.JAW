X ANOVA analyses for Cyanobacteria & ARA

- Extract settings from Template:
  X individual analysis scripts would consist of the initial settings part,
    followed by a source() call to the template to do the rest.
  - can I turn major operations into functions?

- Get Mean differences of Temperature & RH
  between Chamber Treatments (HOBO Data)
- Load    Moisture Data
- Analyze Moisture Data
- Load    Moss Growth Data
- Analyze Moss Growth Data


- Replace print() calls in error messages with cat() (fun.R).  Don't forget to add \n at the end of each line.
  - Or, concatenate all output together to include in the stop() message.

Stop prompts to "Hit <Return> to see next plot:" !!


Current Changes:
================
Standardized Nested ANOVA template (ready, but not applied)

+ Split Template File into modular files within the 'SECCanova' directory:
  + SECC Template - ANOVA.R
	- Starting Point: copy this file, and make desired changes
	- delete lines to use the default (loaded from the template).
  + SECC - ANOVA settings.R
    - default settings for nested ANOVA
	- source()'d in template & main scripts
  + SECC - ANOVA labels.R
    - default text & labels for nested ANOVA
	- source()'d in template & main scripts
  + SECC - nested ANOVA.R
    - Main workhorse script
	- This file is source()'d after initial settings, 
	  to carry out the standardized analysis.
	- I'm still working on converting some of this to functions.
	  - Eventually, the bulk of this script can be moved to 
	    the individual purpose scripts, which will consist of calls 
		to functions to carry out main operations.
	- annoying prompts after plots are back :(
+ strip_empty_dims() function to strip rows and/or columns that are empty
  (all NA).  Fixed.

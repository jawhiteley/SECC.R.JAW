SECC: The Schefferville Experiment on Climate Change (and Habitat Fragmentation / Isolation)
================================================================

This repository contains data and analysis from my a field experiment set up in Schefferville, Quebec,
as part of Jonathan Whiteley's PhD thesis at McGill University (Montreal, QC, Canada), with Dr. Andrew Gonzalez and Dr. Zoë Lindo.
This repository also contains processing and analysis scripts, written in the [R statistical computing language][R].

    [R]: http://r-project.org

Raw data files in `csv` format are stored in the `/data` directory.  
Scripts to process and load the raw data into a format ready for analysis are in the `/lib` directory, along with most functions used throughout the project.
The processed data and other objects are stored in the `/save` directory for fast loading.  
**More detailed instructions on using the data and files in this repository can be found in files in the `/doc` directory.**

*Scripts can load all data and functions simply by running the code in `/lib/init.R`, or the following line of R code* (after setting the working directory to the root `SECC` directory for the project):

    setwd('./ SECC/')       # replace the path with what works on your system
    source('./lib/init.R')

The code in `/lib/init.R` includes `rm(list=ls())` to clear all memory.  
Therefore, the code above should be one of the first lines in a script (after setting the working directory), without relying on other objects in memory.  
If other objects are required, I suggest saving them to disk (e.g. to `/save`), and load them after running `/lib/init.R`.


The organization of the source code in this project is loosely based on the approach used by the [`ProjectTemplate` package in R](http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2010/08/26/projecttemplate/)

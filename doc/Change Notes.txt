Script Plan
================
Each manuscript will have it's own script, which performs all analyses, collect results, and produce output and final plots for publication.
- For now, individual 'sub-scripts' clear memory & re-load data with 'init.R'.  
  Will it be safer to move init.R, or just clear memory, to the higher-order scripts?



ARA Calculation formulas: standardize by umol/ml or umol of ARA gases (C2H2 + C2H4)?
================================
ARA calculation formulas -- How do the final values compare:

  * standardizing blanks by C2H2 (+ C2H4)
  * standardizing blanks & controls by umol / volume?
  * using 'raw' umol amounts?

The difference appears to be very minor: 4th+ decimal place.

  - There are 4 more values >0 in t2 using volumetric standardization, 
    but I strongly suspect these are extremely small values anyway.  
    I wouldn't worry about it.
  - The difference in t4 is not noticeable.

The large number of values < 0 has more to do with extremely small values
  that are smaller than the Controls / Blanks (especially the Controls).

# Checking Input Data

Checking data happens in 4 basic steps

1. Standardize Column Names
2. Manual processing, cleaning, calculations
3. Standardize ID values
[Merge]
4. Re-coding ID values to informative labels.

## ID Column Names

SECCcolumns() function matches columns in the data frame to expected synonyms, and re-names them to a common standard, ensuring consistency across all imported data.

## Manual Processing

Cleaning data, removing extra ID factor levels.  In the load.R script, or a separate load_data.R script specific to each file or type of data.

## Standard ID Values (factor levels)

checkSECCdata()
Do I care more about missing standard levels (subset), [No] or extra non-standard levels? *****
Some factors I expect to have missing levels (e.g. Time, Position), whereas others might have extra levels specific to the data (e.g. ARA controls).
Controls are specified by extra information in SampleID.
Extra factor levels may not be a problem with the correct merge settings: un-matched rows can simply be omitted from the merge result.

Actual Factors should contain *ONLY* standard levels. Otherwise, it is too difficult to automatically check for errors.


## Re-coding IDs to informative labels.

recodeSECC() function
I'm not sure if this needs to be done in the load phase, but it is useful for meaningful plot labels, and avoiding cryptic codes in the final output.
I am definitely used to thinking in terms of the treatment codes, so it might actually be easier to keep the codes for writing analysis scripts.
Nevertheless, re-coding the main data frames also ensures consistent labels across all analyses.

# Checking Output Data for analysis

The `SECCstr()` function provides a breakdown of the number of samples with data
(not NA) in each factor level.  It is useful for checking for extra, unbalanced,
or missing values, if you know what the numbers *should* be.

## Cyanobacteria

The basic data is all samples from: (I)nner, (O)uter ; Ambient (A), Full Chamber (C).
There are a few extra samples in t1, particularly from Blocks 1 - 3,
including 3 from Partial Chambers (B).

## Acetylene Reduction Assay data (ARA)

I have ARA data from EVERY patch in the experiment, plus:
+ moss-only controls in all (I)nner & (O)uter patches,
+  gas-only blanks: at least one per block, 4 per block in t4: 
   t4 has a blank sample at the start & end of each jar.
   There were 2 jars per block: each jar covered one full chamber treatment, 
   and half of the third.  The fragmentation treatments for the blanks within
   the split chamber are specified in the "Frag" column of the original
   spreadsheet, and incorporated into the new SampleIDs in the R script.
